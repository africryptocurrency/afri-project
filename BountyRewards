Bounties:

Afri is a bounty driven cryptocurrency, and we aim to use bounties as an economic incentive to grow the use and features of the network. The bounties are not time limited and will be granted on a first-come first-served basis. If the crowdsale results in higher than expected funds, then these will be distributed proportionally across all the bounties.

Wallet/Code Bounties (Total: 500 000 000 Afri)

• Free 250 000 Afri in each of the first 1000 wallet downloads (total 250 000 000 Afri);
• Porting the wallet code to iOS 11 (total 100 000 000 Afri proportionally divided by the relative number of github commits and our interpretation of their impact, to prevent abuse, + $10 000 from the crowdsale divided in equal parts through bitcoin, ether, and litecoin);
• New wallet features and network optimizations (up to 10 proposals, total of 150 000 000 Afri available to distribute between these 10 proposals at the joint judgement of the three founders, + $10 000 from the crowdsale divided in equal parts through bitcoin, ether, and litecoin).

Language Bounties (Total: 350 000 000 Afri)

While we will release our initial alpha with 5 available languages (English, French, Portuguese, Afrikaans, and Modern Standard Arabic), we are looking to include 31 more languages over the next months and perhaps even years. The translation work to be done concerns only the GUI, and the rewards will be distributed in three different phases based on the relative number of speakers of those languages. The base GUI file will be released in English in our github repository following the release of the alpha wallet (30th of November 2017). Below you can read the target languages and rewards:

1st phase languages: Hausa, Yoruba, Oromo, Fulani, Amharic, Igbo, Malagasy, Somali, Berber, and Swahili.

1st phase rewards: 20 000 000 Afri + $2000 from the crowdsale (divided in equal parts through bitcoin, ether, and litecoin) per Language (total 200 000 000 Afri) 

2nd phase languages: Shona, Akan, Zulu, Kinyarwanda, Chewa, Kirundi, Mossi, Xhosa, Tigrinya, and Gikuyu

2nd phase rewards: 10 000 000 Afri + $1000 from the crowdsale (divided in equal parts through bitcoin, ether, and litecoin) per Language (total 100 000 000 Afri)

3rd phase languages: Tshiluba, Umbundu, Tswana, Kongo, Sesotho, Lingala, Luganda, Northern Sotho, Dholno, Mauritian Creole, and Ndebele.

3rd phase rewards: 5 000 000 Afri + $500 from the crowdsale (divided in equal parts through bitcoin, ether, and litecoin) per Language (total 50 000 000 Afri)

Google translations will not be accepted. Language submissions will be handled manually by us, so make sure you provide your bitcoin, ethereum, and litecoin public addresses when submitting your request so we know where to send your rewards if you are accepted and when you do deliver the translation.

Design Bounties (Total: 300 000 000 Afri)

We will reserve 100 000 000 Afri + $10 000 from the crowdsale (divided in equal parts through bitcoin, ether, and litecoin) to reward a new logo design to replace our current one should a community vote with over 1000 votes decide on an alternative logo. The remaining 200 000 000 Afri + $20 000 from the crowdsale (divided in equal parts through bitcoin, ether, and litecoin) will be distributed to several GUI design proposals as well as for new wallet/app option arrangements, should a strong case be presented as to why said changes would optimize the user experience. Failing to achieve both these goals, the Afri and equivalent USD will be used as rewards for Other Bounties (see below).

Community Bounties (Total: 200 000 000 Afri)

50 000 000 Afri + $5000 from the crowdsale (divided in equal parts through bitcoin, ether, and litecoin) will be distributed between the first five websites where:

1.   Afri’s general, technical, and ideological information is presented in a fair way;

2.   Links are provided in the website to this bitcointalk thread and our github repository for the official download links;

3.   The website itself hosts the official download files and commits to keeping them up to date (as a prevention against our github repository getting seized by malicious actors).

4.   The website should have the information in English, French, and Portuguese at the very minimum.

50 000 000 Afri + $5000 from the crowdsale (divided in equal parts through bitcoin, ether, and litecoin) will be distributed to the first 10 videos that explain what Afri is under 3 minutes, in English, French, Portuguese, Afrikaans, and one or more Northern-African languages (each video only needs one language, subtitles in the other target languages are encouraged).

50 000 000 Afri + $5000 from the crowdsale (divided in equal parts through bitcoin, ether, and litecoin) for the first 10 video tutorials on downloading and getting started using Afri, as well as claiming one’s Afris from the crowdsale, with no time limit, in English, French, Portuguese, Afrikaans, and one or more Northern-African languages (each video only needs one language, subtitles in the other target languages are encouraged).

25 000 000 Afri + $2500 from the crowdsale (divided in equal parts through bitcoin, ether, and litecoin) for the creation of an active though unofficial reddit, twitter, telegram, slack, and facebook communities, with the rewards being distributed proportionally based on metrics such as daily views, comments, upvotes, posts, etc after one month of the community page being created.

25 000 000 Afri + $2500 from the crowdsale (divided in equal parts through bitcoin, ether, and litecoin) for newspaper/magazine/flyers/tv advertisements referencing Afri in whatever African country they are displayed.

Other bounties (Remaining Afri)

The remaining Afri from either the difference in funding phases or an extra source of funding will be allocated for two uses. Half will be to reward Afri/Fiat exchanges in Africa only. The funding will be distributed through the first 3 exchanges that are created in the form of free Afri to the first 100 users that sign up in each exchange. The second will serve to reward bug bounties after the end of the crowdsale and user feedback of app use for one month.
