# afri-project
The official github repository of the Afri Cryptocurrency project

This is the official location of all future software releases, and where all software development should take place.

AFRI is an African targeted cryptocurrency with a total supply of 4 000 000 000 coins. It is a Proof-of-Stake/Directed Acyclic Graph hybrid, with a 49% distribution via an on-going crowdsale and another 49% via bounty rewards (where both Afri and collected cryptocurrency from the crowdsale are rewarded).
