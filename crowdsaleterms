Crowdsale:

The objective of the crowdsale is two-fold: reward investors and traders for their trust in the project at an early stage, while using the funds collected to reward users through the bounty system to develop the network and community.

The crowdsale begins 24h after this post has been submitted and will last until the 31st of December 2017. The equivalent number of coins per investment is distributed in three phases:

1st phase: 14th October – 20th November: 800 000 000 Afri at a rate of 1 Afri = 0.0001 USD (cryptocurrency equivalent*). Should there be more funding than the initial valuation, the Afri will be distributed at a different rate proportional to each investors’ stake.

2nd Phase: 21st November – 10th December: 700 000 000 Afri at a rate of 1 Afri = 0.00015 USD (cryptocurrency equivalent*). Should there be more funding than the initial valuation, the Afri will be distributed at a different rate proportional to each investors’ stake.

3rd Phase: 11th December – 31st December: 480 000 000 Afri at a rate of 1 Afri = 0.0002 USD (cryptocurrency equivalent*). Should there be more funding than the initial valuation, the Afri will be distributed at a different rate proportional to each investors’ stake.

*We define cryptocurrency equivalent as the rate of USD to your cryptocurrency of choice (bitcoin, ether, or litecoin) at the market value in Bitfinex exchange on the timestamp at which your transaction is received in the Afri crowdsale wallet, expressed in the equation: Claimable Afri = (USD rate of your cryptocurrency * number of cryptocurrency units sent) / equivalent crowdsale phase price. For example, if 1 BTC = $5000 when you send your bitcoin transaction, and you send 0.01 BTC during the first crowdsale phase, then you will receive 5000*0.01/0.0001 = 50 000 Afri. 

As mentioned above, if there is more funding than the initial valuation, we will have a proportional reward, wherein:

Claimable Afri = (Total Afri supply in the respective phase / USD rate of each cryptocurrency * number of cryptocurrency units sent) * (USD rate of your cryptocurrency * number of cryptocurrency units you have sent).

We have made what might seem like a “low” valuation since we prize the utility of the network we will create more than the monetary incentives we (founders) could gain from it, so our bounty system was made with the minimum viable investment possible in mind to kickstart it.
